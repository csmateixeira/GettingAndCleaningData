### Feature labels

Feature labels were modified in the following pattern: 

* "-" was removed
* "()" was removed
* starting "t" -> "time"
* starting "f" -> "frequency"
* "BodyBody" -> "body"
* "Acc" -> "accelerator"
* "Gyro" -> "gyroscope"
* "Mag" -> "magnitude"

The final feature name transformations included in the tidy dataset were as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Original name</th>
        <th>Transformed Name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-mean()-X</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratormeanx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-mean()-Y</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratormeany</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-mean()-Z</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratormeanz</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-std()-X</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratorstdx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-std()-Y</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratorstdy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-std()-Z</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratorstdz</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-std()-Z</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratorstdz</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-std()-Z</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratorstdz</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>tBodyAcc-std()-Z</td>
        <td>timebodyacceleratorstdz</td>
    </tr>
</table>
